### The Hierarchy window

The Hierarchy window displays every GameObject in a Scene, such as models, Cameras, or Prefabs. You can use the Hierarchy window to sort and group the GameObjects you use in a Scene. When you add or remove GameObjects in the Scene view, you also add or remove them from the Hierarchy window.

The Hierarchy window can also contain other Scenes, with each Scene
 containing their own GameObjects.

  </tr>
 </table>



 ### The Project window

The Project window displays all of the files related to your Project and is the main way you can navigate and find Assets and other Project files in your application. When you start a new Project by default this window is open. However, if you cannot find it, or it is closed, you can open it via Window > General > Project or press Ctrl+5 (macOS: Cmd+5).

  </tr>

 ### The Scene view

The Scene view is your interactive view into the world you are creating. You can use the Scene view to select and position scenery, characters, Cameras, lights, and all other types of GameObjects.Selecting manipulating, and modifying GameObjects in the Scene view are some of the first skills you must learn to begin working in Unity.

  </tr>
 </table>



 ### The Game view

The Game view is rendered from the Camera(s) in your application. It represents your final, published application. You need to use one or more Cameras
 to control what the player sees when they are using your application. For more information about Cameras, see the Camera Component page.

 ### The Inspector View

Use the Inspector window to view and edit properties and settings for almost everything in the Unity Editor, including GameObjects, Unity components, Assets, Materials, and in-Editor settings and preferences.

  </tr>
 </table>



 ### Console Window

The Console Window displays errors, warnings, and other messages the Editor generates. These errors and warnings help you find issues in your project, such as script compilation errors. They also alert you to actions the Editor has taken automatically, such as replacing missing meta files, which could cause an issue somewhere else in your project.

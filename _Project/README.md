# Announcements

You must have any android device for having App Gallery account and 
releasing your game on App Gallery. But you have to setup App Gallery
and HMS Core.

(If you dont have android device you can release your game on 
your friend s App Gallery account.)

You cannot test hms-unity-plugin on Unity editor. For this you can use

or 

Android device having HMS Core apk.
